# Mapping LoRaWAN coverage

To map the coverage, [Adeunis Field Tester](https://www.adeunis.com/en/produit/ftd-network-tester/), [CubeCell GPS-6502](https://heltec.org/project/htcc-ab02s/) and a [RAK Helium Field Mapper](https://store.rakwireless.com/products/field-mapper-for-helium-with-plug-play-and-3rd-party-mode-rak10701-h?variant=42437640782022) are used. More on how mapping is done can be found in the [Helium Mapper documentation](https://docs.helium.com/iot/coverage-mapping/).
