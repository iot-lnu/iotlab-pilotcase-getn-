The `gateway_key.bin` file contains the private key for a Helium gateway. This key is used for authentication on the Helium network and for minting an NFT on the Solana blockchain to represent the gateway. IOT tokens can be earned through data relay, and the gateway's coverage can be mapped by external parties. The file essentially serves as the gateway's digital identity.
